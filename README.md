# HearingApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.19.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Constraints

This was my first angular application ever. So tried to use React which I am use to to guide my design. Was also limitted for time since a have muplti assessments with different companies to complete as well as I hosted a refactoring workshop on the book [Refactoring by Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) on Saterday that took some of my time.

## Uncompleted

Still need to download the sound locally in the download step, just played the audio directly on the test step.

Need to add the use case when you click in jitter on the test that it fails the clossest hearing result. Thought it would be the best solution to know which hearing result to fail when jitter is surrounded by 2 frequencies.

## Improvements

Would want to add tests, you can look at some of my projects on github to see that I love testing, but due to time constraint in new framework, I did not get to it.
